  - Start at cup 15
2. Remove a number from the cup of pennies from the pile
3. Randomly take 1-3 pennies as the "player"
4. Check the cup equal to the number of pennies
  - Select random number from cup
5. Repeat step 2 - 4 until no pennies are left
6. If the "player" took the last penny, don't do anything
  - Otherwise, remove the last randomly selected option
7. Repeat from step 1 for a long time
